My code was written with the best practices in mind. I was making sure to constantly test my code and writting small chucnks at a time. Many of the things I used for my code help the user understand what is going on by indenting and making sure that it was as detailed as possible; and could possibly be used for future codes.
When creating a code the best thing to do is what is going to be the most demanded thing a user is going to need this code for. Making the decision based on interviews you have with potential users and making sure you are pinpointing the required infomration. The best thing would be after you inish your code getting feedback from users as they start using it will help perfect the code to its fullest potential.
